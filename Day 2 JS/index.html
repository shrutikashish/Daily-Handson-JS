    Data Types - There are two data Types
    1.Primitive 2.Non-Primitive
     
    1.Primitive Data Types- String,Number,Boolean etc
     a.string - Anything which is present inside the double quotes or the single 
                quotes are called as Strings.
     b.Boolean- It has only two values True or False.
     c.Number- Includes integer and decimal values.

     Keyword are of three types - 
     a.let   b.const  c.var

     a.let: These keywords are used to assign variables with values
         1 . They can be declared in a line and then initialized with a value in anaother lines.
         2. They can be also declared and initialized in the same line
         3 . They cannot be redeclared.....But can be reinitialized....
         4. We cannot have Two Variables with same name in Let
     
     b.const:These keywords are used to assign variables with values
         1. They can be declared and initialized in the same line only.
         2 . They cannot be redeclared.....
         3. But const "cant" be reinitialized also....
         4. We cannot have Two Variables with same name in const
     
     c.var: These keywords are used to assign variables with values
        1 . They can be declared in a line and then initialized with a value in another lines.
        2. They can be also declared and initialized in the same line
        3. They can be redeclared.....and also can be reinitialized....
        4.We can have Two or more Variables with same name in Var
